Fortunately, prediction doesn’t always require a causal relationship between predictor and response. Instead, a proxy variable that is simply correlated to the response, and is easier to obtain than a causally connected variable, might well do the job.

	* This is called ‘redundant encoding’ – even if a specific data marker is not included in the data set, it may be included by proxy in a combination of other, relevant data.
	* Before anyone starts a flame war, please read carefully! “At the heart of our approach is the idea that individuals who qualify for a desirable outcome should have an equal chance of being correctly classified for this outcome." That means they are NOT going for some sort of "affirmative action" type of logic.
